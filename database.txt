To test everything I created two databases with table called users. One have unique check, second doesn't. So first save works, 2nd throws exception and causes rollback. Structure is below.

For postgresql:

CREATE TABLE users
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  name character varying,
  CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT users_name_key UNIQUE (name)
);

CREATE TABLE users
(
  id serial NOT NULL,
  name character varying,
  CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
